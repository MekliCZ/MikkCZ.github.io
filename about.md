My name is **Michal Stanke**. I am a student of FEE CTU in Prague and I work for Cisco Systems. I am also a proud [Mozillian](https://mozillians.org/u/mstanke/) and a [Mozilla Rep](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mstanke/) from Czech Republic. Mostly I take care of the Czech localization and [Mozilla.cz](https://www.mozilla.cz/) community activities.
